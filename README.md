# Soccer Match Prediction Model

## Overview
The **Soccer Match Prediction Model** is a machine learning project that predicts the outcomes of soccer matches based on historical data. It automates data collection through web scraping and leverages machine learning techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Features
- **Automated Data Collection**: Uses web scraping (BeautifulSoup and requests) to fetch real-time match data.
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Implements pandas and NumPy for cleaning and structuring data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes the Random Forest classification algorithm from scikit-learn.
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuous updates ensure model accuracy improvements.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup, requests, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest Classifier

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tahash4h/soccer-match-prediction.git
   cd soccer-match-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script to collect data:
   ```bash
   python data_scraper.py
   ```
4. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
5. Make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

## Data Collection
- **Source**: Web scraping from soccer statistics websites.
- **Tools**: BeautifulSoup, requests.
- **Stored Format**: CSV files for structured analysis.

## Model Training
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier.
- **Training Process**: Data is split into training and test sets.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy and Precision.

## Usage
- Run predictions on upcoming matches.
- Analyze model performance and update training data accordingly.
- Extend the project with additional features like deep learning models.

## Future Improvements
- Implement additional ML models (e.g., Neural Networks, XGBoost).
- Improve web scraping with APIs for more accurate real-time data.
- Develop a web-based interface for user interaction.
